🌟 **Project Alert!** 🌟

Excited to share that I’ve created a **Mini Calendar** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**! 🗓️

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of **DOM manipulation**, **date and time handling**, and building **interactive UI components** with a clean, responsive design.

💡 **Key Highlights:**

* Displays real-time date, month, and year
* Clean and minimal UI built with HTML & CSS
* Dynamic updates powered by JavaScript

Each small project like this brings me one step closer to mastering front-end development! 💪
